2 - Affiliate networks direct image links from the top UK affiliate networks such as CJ.com, Awin.com etc. These are product images imported when the data is imported via the APi. 

No harm or illegal activity is connected to these images. These are product or category images coming from reliable sources approved by the RevGlue team.
